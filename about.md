Welcome! Thanks for visiting!

I'm Aram, an Electrical Engineer who has been desiging Mixed-Signal (Analog+Digital) Integrated Circuits for the last decade. My specialty is Analog to Digital Converters, but I have experience in nearly every type of circuit you can find. Most recently, I am a part of Qualcomm's ADC Design Team, which develops cutting edge IP for all of our product lines.

This blog exists to share insights and experiences had during my time as a designer, and also to document the history of my newest hobby: [Homelabbing](https://reddit.com/r/homelab).

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [send me an email](mailto:contact@servingcircuits.blog).

Thanks for reading!
