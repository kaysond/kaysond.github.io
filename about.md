Welcome!

I'm Aram, an Electrical Engineer who has been desiging Mixed-Signal (Analog+Digital) Integrated Circuits for the last decade. My specialty is Analog to Digital Converters, but I have experience in nearly every type of circuit you can find. Most recently, I am a part of Qualcomm's ADC Design Team, which develops cutting edge IP for all of our product lines.

This blog exists to share insights and experiences had during my time as a designer, and also to document the history of my newest hobby: [Homelabbing](https://reddit.com/r/homelab).

Thanks for reading!

## What's with the domain?
-1.602176634e-19 is the [electric charge of an electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_charge), but you can't start a domain with '-', so I used 'n', which is often used by EE'sto denote negative numbers when our archaic software can't handle hyphens.
