Welcome!

I'm Aram, an Electrical Engineer who has been desiging Mixed-Signal (Analog+Digital) Integrated Circuits for the last decade. My specialty is Analog to Digital Converters, but I have experience in nearly every type of circuit you can find. Most recently, I joined Qualcomm's Design Automation Team, which, among many things, develops infrastructure and tools to speed up, improve, or automate the circuit design process.

I started this blog to share insights and experiences I've had during my time as an EE and to document some of my projects.

Thanks for reading!

## What's with the domain?
-1.602176634e-19 is the [charge of an electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_charge), but you can't start a domain with '-', so I used 'n', which is often used by EE's to denote negative numbers when our archaic software can't handle hyphens.
